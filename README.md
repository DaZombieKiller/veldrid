# ppy.Veldrid

Veldrid is a cross-platform, graphics API-agnostic rendering and compute library for .NET. It provides a powerful, unified interface to a system's GPU and includes more advanced features than any other .NET library. Unlike other platform- or vendor-specific technologies, Veldrid can be used to create high-performance 3D applications that are truly portable.

As of April 2024, this repository no longer tracks and is incompatible with the upstream [Veldrid](https://github.com/veldrid/veldrid) repository. This decision has been made to allow for more agile development without concerns of breaking changes.
